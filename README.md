# Tale-of-Kingdoms

Tale of Kingdoms started as a castle-control game, but quickly just became a learning experience for work with models, "vehicles" (anything the player can control), and some more exotic gameplay features.

I put way too much into gameplay design, and soon decided that I'd rather work on finishing a product in the same vein. The gameplay architecture became "Gridland-Defender."
